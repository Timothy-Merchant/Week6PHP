8.3 PSR-4 Autoloading

The PSR-4 autoloading spec basically ties namespaces to a directory structure within
a specified directory. Composer can do all the work of autoloading for us, but we
do need to set it up.
First, create a directory called app. Then edit the composer.json so that it looks
like this:

{
        "require": {
        "symfony/var-dumper": "^5.1"
    },
        "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {"App\\": "app/"}
    }
}

Here we’ve told Composer that any namespace starting with the root App should
Your require section might look somewhat different

look for files in the app directory. We could use anything as the root namespace
or directory name, but this is the convention.
Next, run composer dump: this regenerates the Composer autoload file for us2.
Now, as long as we stick to the following rules, we won’t need to require any other
files manually:

1. One class per file, where the file name is the same as the class name (case
sensitive)
2. Put all of our classes in the App root namespace
3. If we add directories inside the app directory (for extra organisation), they
add an extra level to the namespace

Because namespaces and classes in PHP are usually capitalised and, with PSR-4,
the directory and filenames match the namespace/class naming, all the files and
directories inside app will also be capitalised.
For example, if we had a class called Post that just sat inside the app directory, it
should be in a file called Post.php and have the namespace App\Post. If we had
a class Post that did something with Slack we could create a directory app/Slack
and then put the file Post.php in it with the namespace App\Slack\Post.
